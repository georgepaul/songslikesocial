IMPORTANT NOTICE:
PLEASE CREATE A BACKUP OF ALL YOUR FILES AND DATABASES BEFORE UPDATING THIS SCRIPT
***********************************************************************************

To check which version you are currently running please login as admin and visit:
Settings -> Script info -> Check for updates
or open version.php file inside application root folder

Make sure your web server has full permissions on all files and folders. Double-check
whether this is still the case after you update the script.

AUTOMATIC UPDATE (risky):
If you haven't changed any files or customize the app you can upload all files
to your server and application will update automatically. You will have to overwrite 
some files like index.php, install.php etc. Please check if you need to adjust
your .htaccess after an update (if you have a custom one). 

MANUAL UPDATE:
To update your customized version of SocialStrap unzip all files from data.zip 
archive and look into each new version txt file in this folder for which files need
to be replaced on your server. If you have skipped some update then you must
read instructions and replace files for all versions in between up to the 
current version.
